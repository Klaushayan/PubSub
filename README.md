# PubSub

A simple pub sub server written in Python.
Not to be used in production (for obvious reasons), it's not secure, not tested well, not optimized, and has no error handling.

Initially, It was meant to use HTTP as a transport layer, but I decided to use RPC instead for simplicity and performance. It was developed in a few hours, so it has a lot of room for improvement.

This was done as a part of a job interview, but I decided to publish it anyway. I might pick it up again in the future and improve or rewrite it completely.
